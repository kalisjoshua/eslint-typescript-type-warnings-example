# ESLint Reporting TypeScript (compiler) Warnings

This repository is an attempt to put together a project where [ESLint] will
report all of the [TypeScript] compiler errors so that developers have a
consistent experience in any editor. ESLint should be more restrictive than the
TypeScript compiler as linting errors are stylistic not technical problems.
However, the errors reported should be consistent; if the `tsc` reports an error
so should ESLint.
